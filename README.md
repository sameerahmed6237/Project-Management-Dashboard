## ✨ Featured Project: Task-to-Calendar Synchronization Engine

This project showcases core expertise in **System Integration and Process Automation** by creating a reliable, full-cycle synchronization loop between a relational database and a critical external scheduling API.

### Technical Achievements & Automation Flow

| Component | Achievement & Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal & Value** | Eliminated manual scheduling conflicts and calendar clutter by creating a system that keeps task management and scheduling in perfect sync. |
| **Automation Engine** | Established a **full-cycle, rules-based automation** using **Zapier** (or **Make.com**) to govern the entire task lifecycle, demonstrating proficiency in low-code orchestration. |
| **Conditional Creation** | Implemented logic to automatically **create a Google Calendar event** (with specific deadlines) immediately upon task assignment in the relational database. |
| **Data Integrity Loop (The USP)** | Designed a critical synchronization loop that executes **conditional deletion** of the scheduled event in Google Calendar the moment the task's status is updated to **`Completed`** in Airtable. This proves mastery of API write/delete operations based on database triggers. |
| **Technical Stack** | **Airtable** (Relational Database Design) $\leftrightarrow$ **Zapier** (Process Orchestration) $\leftrightarrow$ **Google Calendar API** (Service Integration) |
